# Currency Converter Project

This project is a simple currency converter application that allows users to view real-time exchange rates and convert between multiple currencies. The header displays the current exchange rates for USD and EUR against the Ukrainian hryvnia (UAH) using data from a public API.

Features:
Real-Time Exchange Rates: Fetches live exchange rates for USD, EUR, and UAH.
Currency Conversion: Allows users to convert between UAH, USD, and EUR. The conversion happens in both directions, updating dynamically when values or currencies are changed in either input.
